/*72. Write a C++ program to which reads n digits chosen from 0 to 9 and counts
the number of combinations where the sum of the digits equals to given number.
Do not use the same digits in a combination.
For example, the combinations where n = 2 and s = 5 are as follows:
0 + 5 = 5
1 + 4 = 5
3 + 2 = 5*/
