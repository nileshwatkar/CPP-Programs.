/*76. An even number of 4 or more can be represented by the sum of two prime
numbers. This is called Goldbach expectation, and it is confirmed that it is correct
up to a considerably large number by computer calculation. For example, 10 can
be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers 7 + 3, 5 + 5. Write a C++
program that accept an integer (n) from the user and outputs the number of
combinations that express n as a sum of two prime numbers.
Note: n should be greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 50,000*/
