/*84. Write a C++ program to check whether the sequence of the numbers in a
given array is a "Arithmetic" or "Geometric" sequence. Return -1 if the sequenc is
not "Arithmetic" or "Geometric".
From Wikipedia
In mathematics, an arithmetic progression (AP) or arithmetic sequence is a
sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is
constant. Difference here means the second minus the first. For instance, the
sequence 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, . . . is an arithmetic progression with common
difference of 2.
In mathematics, a geometric progression, also known as a geometric sequence,
is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying
the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. For
example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with common
ratio 3. Similarly 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, ... is a geometric sequence with common ratio
1/2.
Example:
Sample Input: int nums1[] = { 1, 3, 5, 7 }
Sample Output: Arithmetic sequence*/
